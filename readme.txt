Notify the comment author via email when someone replies to his/her comment.

== Description ==

The plugin notifies the comment author via email when someone replies to his/her comment. The current features of this plugin:

* Comment reply notification
* Notify on comment modification
* Custom email templates

== Customize email templates

You're able to customize reply, re-notify and modification email templates. Copy the plugin's "templates" folder to your theme folder & set your own design.
